# Firmadyne Automation for IoT Firmware Emulation

This project provides a fully working, automated setup and execution environment for Firmadyne, tailored for modern IoT firmware analysis.

## Why This Exists

Most public Firmadyne forks are outdated, broken, or require complex setup steps that frustrate both beginners and experienced analysts. I built this system to:

- Actually work out of the box
- Handle the full firmware emulation lifecycle
- Be easy enough for students and labs, but powerful for real use

Behind the scenes, this setup automatically takes care of:

- Installing all required dependencies (QEMU, Binwalk, PostgreSQL, etc.)
- Setting up the full Firmadyne environment
- Unpacking firmware (supports `.bin`, `.img`, `.zip`)
- Detecting architecture (MIPS, ARM, etc.)
- Generating emulation images and patching them
- Booting the firmware in QEMU with no manual steps

## Features

- Full automation of firmware extraction, analysis, and boot
- Tested and working on Kali Linux (2023+)
- Logs and cleanup handled automatically
- Root login disabled on boot is bypassed automatically
- SSH/HTTP detection and access through QEMU
- Default PostgreSQL password is handled internally (`firmadyne`)

## Installation and Usage

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ThinkCyberProjects/firmadyne-auto.git
cd firmadyne-auto
```

### Step 2: Run the One-Time Setup Script

```bash
sudo bash Firmadyne_setup.sh
```

This will install everything and prepare the system. After setup, you'll see:

```
[âœ”] Setup complete.
To run: sudo bash /opt/firmadyne/Firmadyne.sh
```

### Step 3: Run and Emulate a Firmware Image

```bash
sudo bash /opt/firmadyne/Firmadyne.sh
```

You'll be prompted to:

1. Enter the full path to the firmware file
2. Enter a vendor name (any label you want)

Example:

```
Enter full path to firmware file: /home/kali/Desktop/firmware.zip
Enter the firmware vendor: netgear
```

The script will:

1. Extract the firmware
2. Detect architecture
3. Patch and build the filesystem
4. Boot it in QEMU automatically

## How It Works

This tool automates every part of the Firmadyne pipeline:

| Step | What It Does |
|------|--------------|
| Firmware extraction | Handles .bin, .zip, .img formats |
| Architecture check | Uses getArch.sh and ELF parsing to detect CPU type |
| Database setup | Inserts firmware into PostgreSQL for tracking |
| Image generation | Builds QEMU-compatible rootfs image |
| Patching | Disables root password, configures tty, etc. |
| Emulation | Boots QEMU with the correct options |

All intermediate files and logs are saved in `/opt/firmadyne`.

## Database Access

The PostgreSQL database is configured automatically with these credentials:

- **Username:** firmadyne
- **Password:** firmadyne

You won't need to manually manage any database settings.

## Reset and Cleanup

To reset the system before running a new firmware image, just re-run the launcher:

```bash
sudo bash /opt/firmadyne/Firmadyne.sh
```

It will:

- Flush the database
- Clean old image files
- Reset the environment

## After Booting

Once the firmware is running in QEMU:

1. Check open ports using `nmap -p- 192.168.0.100`
2. Try accessing services in your browser or terminal
3. Log in with known credentials or analyze the rootfs you extracted earlier

Example (accessing web interface):

```
http://192.168.0.100
```

## Requirements

This has been tested on:

- Kali Linux (2023.1+)
- Debian-based systems

Make sure your system supports:

- QEMU
- 64-bit virtualization
